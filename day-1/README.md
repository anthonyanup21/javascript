Today I learned about operator precedence in JavaScript, where multiplication and division have higher priority than addition and subtraction, and how parentheses can change the evaluation order. I also learned about different data types in JavaScript such as number, string, boolean, undefined, null, BigInt, and Symbol. Additionally, I practiced type conversion, where adding + or - in front of a value can convert a string into a number during execution.
